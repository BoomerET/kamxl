# Matches a KAM-XL MONITOR header line. Format observed on real
# hardware, with MCOM and MRESP at their factory defaults (both
# ON/ON):
#
#   SOURCE>DESTINATION[,DIGI1,DIGI2*]/PORT: <TAG>:
#
# e.g.:
#
#   K5LRK>BEACON/2: <UI>:
#   WB5NZV>KD5EOC-10,RSSTN*/2: <<C>>:
#   KD5EOC-10>WB5NZV,RSSTN/2: <<I00>>:
#
# The bracketed tag is the KAM-XL's own frame-type annotation --
# single "<...>" for an AX.25 v1 packet, double "<<...>>" for v2 (see
# MCOM/MRESP in the manual). It's controlled by MCOM/MRESP, not by
# MONITOR itself, and both default to ON -- so on a stock
# configuration, *every* monitored header carries one of these, not
# just connect/control frames. An earlier version of this regex had
# no allowance for it at all, which meant HEADER_RE never matched a
# single real-hardware header line -- every line silently failed to
# parse (dropped, since _process_line() only appends non-matching
# lines to an already-pending packet -- with nothing ever matching,
# nothing ever became pending either), and the live monitor pane
# stayed empty no matter how much real traffic the KAM-XL was
# actually receiving. Found this way, on real hardware, rather than
# from the manual -- the manual quote above about the tag format was
# only actually confirmed against a live log once this bug surfaced.
#
# Digipeaters that have already repeated the packet are suffixed with
# "*". This is scoped to MONITOR/unsolicited traffic only -- plain
# Convers-mode session text (e.g. a Winlink handshake or a node chat
# session) never matches this shape and is intentionally left alone.

class Packet:
    """
    A single unsolicited packet, as reported by KAM-XL MONITOR output.

    ``digipeaters`` preserves the "*" suffix on any that have already
    repeated the packet (e.g. "K5LRK*") so callers can tell where in
    the path the packet actually is.

    ``payload`` is the packet's info text with the trailing newlines
    from each physical line stripped and rejoined with "\\n" -- i.e.
    it doesn't include the header line itself. ``raw`` keeps the full
    original text (header + payload) for debugging or in case the
    parsed fields are ever wrong.

    ``frame_type`` is the KAM-XL's own bracketed annotation from the
    header line (e.g. "UI", "C", "UA", "D", "DM", "I00", "rr1"), when
    MCOM/MRESP were on and it included one -- None otherwise. "UI" is
    an ordinary unconnected/beacon frame; most other values are AX.25
    connect-session control/supervisory traffic (connect and
    disconnect requests and acknowledgments, numbered info frames,
    receiver-ready acks, ...) that generally carries no payload of
    its own -- see the manual's MCOM/MRESP entries for the full list.

class PacketParser:
    """
    Incrementally reassembles KAM-XL MONITOR output into Packet
    objects.

    MONITOR text arrives from listen()/read_available() in arbitrary,
    not-line-aligned chunks -- observed on real hardware: a single
    line like "Welcome to the Denton County Texas EOC" split across
    reads as "Welcome to the D" / "enton County Texas EOC". Packets
    aren't explicitly delimited either: a packet is only known to be
    complete once the *next* packet's header line arrives (or the
    session ends), so this has to buffer across an unknown number of
    feed() calls.

        parser = PacketParser()

            for packet in parser.feed(text):
                handle(packet)
