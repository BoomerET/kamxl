"""
Parsing/building helpers for the FBB forwarding protocol used by
Winlink RMS Packet gateways (milestone 8) -- the same relationship
pbbs.py has to raw PBBS text, and packet.py to raw MONITOR text.

Winlink is a real, separately-documented protocol layered on top of
ordinary AX.25 connected-mode sessions -- not something reverse
engineered from the KAM-XL manual. Two sources were used to build
this module, both fetched and cross-checked before writing any code:

  - The official B2F spec: https://winlink.org/B2F
  - The underlying FBB forwarding protocol: http://www.f6fbb.org/protocole.html
  - The secure-login algorithm specifically was ported from
    wl2k-go (https://github.com/la5nta/wl2k-go), a real, widely-used
    open-source Winlink client library -- and verified against its
    own published test vectors (see SECURE_LOGIN_TEST_VECTORS below
    and tests/test_winlink.py) before being trusted here. That's the
    one piece of this module that's actually confirmed correct, as
    opposed to "matches the spec as written."

SCOPE (chosen deliberately, see PROJECT.md milestone 8): plain ASCII
FBB tier only -- this module never claims B/B1/B2 (compressed
protocol) support in its own SID, so a real Winlink gateway (which
must stay backward-compatible with plain FBB per its own spec) will
never propose a compressed/binary message to us. That means no LZHUF
compression, no binary YAPP-style framing, no checksums to implement
-- proposals and message bodies are all plain text.

REAL CONSEQUENCE OF THAT CHOICE, WORTH KNOWING UP FRONT: per the B2F
spec itself, "If a station cannot support the B2 protocol then only
the message body is transmitted and information content of the header
is lost." That means messages received through this module will NOT
carry Winlink's normal structured address header (Mid:/Date:/Type:/
From:/To:/Subject:/Body:/File: fields, described in the B2F spec) --
just a plain FBB title line and body text, the same reduced shape a
classic non-Winlink FBB packet BBS message would have. This is a
genuine capability tradeoff of the ascii-only scope choice, not a bug.

RECEIVE-ONLY (MVP scope): this module has no support for building an
outbound proposal -- KAMXL.check_winlink_mail() (kamxl.py) always
tells the gateway it has nothing to send ("FF" immediately after
login) and only ever accepts whatever the gateway proposes back.
Composing/sending a new message is a followup, not this pass.

SINGLE BLOCK ONLY (MVP scope): the FBB protocol allows up to five
message proposals per block, with more blocks following if there's
more mail waiting. This module's caller (KAMXL.check_winlink_mail())
only reads one block per call -- if a real account ever has more than
five pending messages, only the first five come back on one call;
calling again should fetch the next batch, but this hasn't been
tested against real traffic where that would actually happen.

PARTIALLY VERIFIED AGAINST A REAL RMS GATEWAY. The handshake and
secure login were confirmed working end-to-end against a real
gateway (KD5EOC-10): the SID exchange and the ";PQ:"/";PR:" challenge-
response were both observed live and matched what this module
expected. That same test also surfaced a real bug (since fixed -- see
has_end_of_block_marker()'s docstring): the KAM-XL echoes our own
connected-mode transmission back to us, which our own "FF" (always
sent, since this module never proposes anything of its own) could be
mistaken for the gateway's reply if the wrong text was treated as a
stop marker. To be precise: that test's final "no mail waiting"
answer was actually correct, but the bug meant the code never
genuinely reached the gateway's real "FQ" reply before returning --
the "FQ" no-mail path itself wasn't actually exercised that day, just
coincidentally not disproven either.

A second real-hardware test against the same gateway found that it
requires B2 protocol support and disconnects the AX.25 link outright
(printing "*** [3] Use B2 protocol - Disconnecting") rather than
falling back to plain ASCII for a client, like this one, that never
claims "B"/"B1"/"B2" in its own SID -- see parse_disconnect_reason()'s
docstring for the full story and the real bug that test also
surfaced (check_winlink_mail() used to hang and raise a confusing
KAMTimeoutError instead of a clear error when this happened, since
fixed). That finding is what prompted adding real B2 support below.

B2 SUPPORT (this module now claims "B2" in its own SID -- see
build_sid()): the plain-ASCII scope note above is now historical for
the SID itself, but still describes the "FB" ascii-tier proposal path,
kept for any non-Winlink FBB station that might still use it (a B2
station must stay backward-compatible with ascii/B1 per spec). A real
Winlink gateway that negotiates B2 with us is expected to use the "FC"
proposal instead (Winlink's own "encapsulated message" extension --
see B2Proposal, parse_b2_blocks(), and EncapsulatedMessage below),
which DOES carry the full structured address header (Mid/Date/From/
To/Cc/Subject) plus attachment metadata that the ascii tier loses.
B2 messages are LZHUF-compressed (see lzhuf.py) and sent using binary
SOH/STX/EOT block framing, not the ascii tier's plain title+^Z text --
a real, separate wire format, researched from the same two sources
used for the compression codec itself: the official B2F spec's
"Binary Compressed Forward Version 1" section
(http://www.f6fbb.org/protocole.html) and wl2k-go's fbb/b2f.go, which
independently confirm the same SOH-header / STX-chunk / EOT+checksum
framing.

ATTACHMENT SCOPE (deliberately chosen, see PROJECT.md): this first B2
pass parses and exposes the real structured header and message body,
and reports each attachment's name and size (Attachment, below) -- but
does NOT extract or expose attachment file contents. Extracting
attachment bytes is mechanically simple (they're just more bytes in
the same decompressed buffer, per the B2F "Message Structure" spec)
but deliberately out of scope for now, to avoid taking on a
file-storage design question that hasn't been asked for yet.

MIXED-BATCH SCOPE LIMIT: if a single proposal block ever contains a
mix of legacy ascii ("FB") and B2 ("FC") proposals, this module doesn't
attempt to interleave the two different wire formats needed to read
them back -- check_winlink_mail() raises a clear error instead. This
is expected to be rare-to-never in practice: a real Winlink CMS/RMS
gateway that negotiates B2 with us is expected to use FC exclusively
for its own mail (this mirrors wl2k-go's own scope choice -- its
parseProposal() has a literal "// TODO: implement" for the legacy
ascii/B1 proposal codes, meaning even that mature, widely-used real
Winlink client doesn't bother with mixed-tier handling either).

Proposal parsing and message-body extraction are still unverified
against a real populated mailbox -- that needs an account with
actual mail waiting to test, which hasn't happened yet. Expect
the same kind of further correction packet.py's HEADER_RE and
pbbs.py's parsing both needed after their own first real tests. The
LZHUF codec itself (lzhuf.py) is cross-checked against two independent
reference implementations, but real end-to-end interop with a real
gateway's own B2-compressed bytes hasn't been confirmed yet either.

KNOWN DISCONNECT REASONS (real ones seen so far against KD5EOC-10 --
kept here, not baked into check_winlink_mail()'s exception message,
since guessing which one applies has already gone stale once):

  1. "*** [3] Use B2 protocol - Disconnecting" -- the gateway requires
     B2 and won't fall back to ASCII. This is what prompted adding B2
     support (above), so this specific reason shouldn't recur now that
     this module's SID claims B2.
  2. "*** Unknown client types are not allowed on production servers
     -- use cms-z.winlink.org - Disconnecting" -- seen AFTER this
     module started claiming B2 and completing the SID exchange and
     secure login successfully, so this is a different, unrelated
     cause: the production Winlink CMS (which KD5EOC-10 proxies
     sessions to -- note the earlier handshake banner's own "CMS via
     KD5EOC" line) appears to validate the connecting client's
     identity (most likely this module's own app name, "kamxl", in
     its SID/;FW: line) against a list of recognized client software,
     and rejects anything it doesn't recognize on its PRODUCTION
     system -- pointing instead at "cms-z.winlink.org", which appears
     to be a separate test/development CMS instance for exactly this
     situation (new, not-yet-recognized client software). This is NOT
     a protocol bug in this module -- the handshake and secure login
     both completed correctly first -- and it's NOT something this
     module can code its way around: it's a real gatekeeping/policy
     decision on Winlink's infrastructure, not a wire-format detail.
     Resolving it (if it needs resolving) is a question for the
     Winlink Development Team or for however "cms-z" testing is
     actually meant to be reached, not a code change here -- this
     module deliberately does NOT attempt to spoof a different,
     already-recognized client's identity to work around this.

    B2 protocol - Disconnecting (...)" and dropping the AX.25 link
    entirely, rather than falling back to plain-ASCII FBB the way the
    B2F spec's text ("if a station cannot support the B2 protocol then
    only the message body is transmitted") seems to promise. Whatever
    poll was running when that arrived (in the observed case, the
    proposals-detection poll -- it never saw "F>"/"FQ", so ran to its
    full read_timeout and captured the disconnect banner and the
    KAM-XL's own "cmd:" prompt along with it) ends up swallowing the
    "cmd:" prompt that a *subsequent* disconnect_station() call would
    otherwise wait for. Since the KAM-XL doesn't print a new one until
    provoked, and there is nothing left to provoke it with, that
    disconnect_station() call has nothing to wait for and reliably
    times out (observed: "KAMTimeoutError: Timed out returning to
    Command mode", 5 seconds later -- enter_command_mode()'s default
    command_mode_timeout). KAMXL.check_winlink_mail() calls this after
    every poll stage so it can raise a clear, specific error and skip
    the doomed disconnect_station() call instead.
