"""
One cheap, real call to Winlink's HTTP web-service API (winlink_api.py)
to confirm an API key actually works -- no KAM-XL, no serial port, no
daemon or REST server needed, just network access and a real key.

Per the Winlink Development Team's own instructions when they issue a
key ("the API endpoints should be queried sparingly"), this makes
exactly one call: account_exists() for a single callsign -- the
cheapest read available, and enough to prove the key is valid and
account_exists()'s parsing/auth are working end-to-end. It deliberately
does NOT also call get_gateway_status()/nearby_gateways() here; if you
want to try those too, do it separately and sparingly, not as part of
routinely re-running this script.

Reads WINLINK_API_KEY the same way kamxl_daemon.py does: a real
exported environment variable, or a .env file in the current directory
(reuses kamxl_daemon.py's own _load_dotenv() rather than duplicating
that parsing logic) -- see docs/daemon.md's "Winlink API key" section.

Usage:

    python3 examples/winlink_api_check.py [CALLSIGN]

CALLSIGN defaults to "AI6K" if not given.
