"""
Parsing helpers for the KAM-XL's built-in PBBS (Personal Mailbox)
firmware feature.

This is NOT a BBS implemented by this project -- the KAM-XL's own
firmware already handles all of the AX.25 session mechanics, message
storage, forwarding, and SYSOP access. This module just turns its
plain-text PBBS command output into structured Python objects, the
same relationship packet.py has to raw MONITOR text.

Reached via an ordinary local AX.25 CONNECT to MYPBBS -- per the
manual, a connect from the local serial terminal gets automatic SYSOP
privilege, no password exchange needed -- followed by single-letter
commands typed at its own "ENTER COMMAND:" prompt: "L" to list
messages, "R <n>" to read one. kamxl.py's KAMXL.list_pbbs_messages()
and KAMXL.read_pbbs_message() drive that exchange using the same
connect_station()/send_connected()/read_connected()/
disconnect_station() primitives used for any other connected-mode
session -- nothing PBBS-specific at the serial protocol level.

IMPORTANT: unlike most of this project, the parsing here has NOT yet
been validated against a real KAM-XL -- it's built from the manual's
documented output format (message list and message header examples),
not from a captured live session. Per this project's own design
philosophy (see PROJECT.md), that makes it a best-effort first draft,
not a confirmed-correct implementation -- expect it to need
adjustment the same way packet.py's HEADER_RE did once tested for
real. Lines that don't match the expected shape are skipped rather
than raising, specifically so a format surprise degrades gracefully
(fewer parsed messages) instead of blowing up the whole call.
