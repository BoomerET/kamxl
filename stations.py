"""
In-memory "who's where" station database, built from unconnected
APRS position-report traffic seen on the KAM-XL's MONITOR stream.

Milestone 7 (APRS mapping). In-memory only, by explicit design choice
(offered against persisting to SQLite; in-memory won for the MVP) --
restarting the daemon starts the station list over empty, and it
rebuilds naturally as new position traffic arrives, the same way a
real APRS station's own screen would after a power cycle. No history
is kept beyond each station's single latest-known position.

StationTracker.update() is meant to be fed every Packet the daemon's
monitor loop sees (see kamxl_daemon.py) -- it's cheap to call for
every packet, including non-APRS ones, since it just returns None
immediately for anything that isn't a decodable position report.

    conventionally identifies a specific device/use, e.g. -9 for a
    mobile tracker vs the base -1). ``last_heard`` is a time.time()
    epoch timestamp of the packet that produced this state.

    contributed since the tracker was created (i.e. since the daemon
